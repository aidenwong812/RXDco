          The Cannabis Marketplace is saturated with products and brands vying for consumer
          attention. Using attractive and sustainable packaging can give legal marijuana
          distributors an edge to capture consumer attention and influence sales positively.

          In any industry the design of the package is "just as important as the product itself."
          (Reyhle, N., 2020) When talking about winning package design, the components that must be
          considered are the materials that make up the packaging. The print on the outside of the
          package and the design and shape of the package.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          "The print on the outside of any product package is there to inform and educate the
          customer" (Haller, et. al) and should influence the buyer to choose your product rather
          than the alternatives on the market. Zekiri &amp; Hasani note that the primary role of
          packaging is to protect the product within. Yet, they also note it is an "instrument" for
          brand promotion and can boost sales. "Packaging helps companies differentiate the product
          from other brand." At RXDepot, designers are on staff to help cannabis dispensaries design
          package verbiage and logos that enhance product sale ability.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Haller et. al also reported on a trend: the rise of "purpose driven consumers". These are
          buyers who look for products or brands that align with their values. 77% of consumers
          internationally surveyed said that they would choose brands that are "sustainable and
          environmentally responsible" This was true across all age groups, not just Millennials.
          Clearly, placing your cannabis product in a sustainable package will capture a significant
          portion of the cannabis market. In a survey done by The Guardian "70% of consumers view
          brands that use sustainable packaging" with more favor. This is why RXD Co offers the
          fully-sustainable ATID line of packaging made entirely of bio-degradable components. In
          fact, you can get customers to switch to your brand by opting for sustainable packaging,
          as "6 in 10 consumers surveyed are willing to change their shopping habits to reduce
          environmental impact" ( Haller).
