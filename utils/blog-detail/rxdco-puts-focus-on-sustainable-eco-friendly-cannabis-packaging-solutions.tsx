          RXDco, the "forward-thinking" premium cannabis packaging company, innovators of unique,
          child-resistant containers and bags, is aiming to change how consumers think of packaging
          and fill a trending requirement in the Cannabis Industry with their Eco-Friendly,
          sustainable and renewable collections; Atid, PearlLoc, and EcoPro.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Due to the nature of cannabis, there are stringent laws governing its marketing and
          packaging. Among the many regulations already in place, two of the newest states to
          legalize cannabis, New York and New Jersey, have taken things a step further by placing
          mandatory requirements on utilizing environmentally sustainable packaging. For example, in
          NY, a cannabis licensee must ensure their packaging is made from at least 25%
          post-consumer waste. With RXDcos' extensive experience in the industry and unmatched
          R&amp;D capabilities, the company is poised and ready to fill the new environmental
          requirements of NY and NJ, with options already available and many others in the pipeline.

          Of RXDco's many packaging collections, they are most enthusiastic about their
          eco-conscious, Atid, PearlLoc, and EcoPro series, as they represent the very best of
          RXDcos’ sustainability initiatives. As Steven Jay, RXDco's CMO, explains, "We are all
          living on this amazing planet called Earth. It's our home; it provides the oxygen we
          breathe, the food that sustains us, the medicine that heals us, and the materials that
          shelter us. We believe that we must do whatever we can as a company to protect our planet
          for ourselves and our children for generations to come. That's why we are so proud to
          offer companies and consumers the option of going green and choosing environmentally
          friendly, sustainable packaging for their cannabis products."{" "}
