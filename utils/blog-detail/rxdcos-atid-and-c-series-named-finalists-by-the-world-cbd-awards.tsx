          Atid and C-Series are part of RXDco's premium line of products. Atid was designed with
          form, function, and sustainability in mind. It is constructed of biodegradable paper,
          certified child-resistant, and with its patented flex-stretch pull top will keep even the
          most persistent little fingers from gaining access. In addition, Atid's cylindrical shape
          makes for great branding, retail shelf presence, and portability. The C-Series is a
          concentrate lovers' dream boasting a "Push n Turn" Teflon-lined CR cap and glass container
          that simultaneously creates an air-tight seal maintaining product freshness while ensuring
          child safety. Available in a variety of options, including round or square, and finishes
          in clear, black, and white, the C-Series is the perfect concentrate companion always
          available and at home in your pocket or purse.{" "}
