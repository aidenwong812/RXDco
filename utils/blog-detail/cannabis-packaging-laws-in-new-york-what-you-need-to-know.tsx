          {" "}
          As of March 2021, New York State legalized recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and
          older. With the legalization of cannabis comes a host of new regulations and requirements,
          including specific packaging and labeling laws for cannabis products sold in the state. In
          this blog post, we'll take a closer look at the laws surrounding cannabis packaging in New
          York and why they matter.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>Child-resistant packaging</p>{" "}
        <p>
          One of the most important requirements for cannabis packaging in New York is that it must
          be child-resistant. This means that the packaging must be designed to be difficult for
          children to open in order to prevent accidental ingestion or exposure. The Consumer
          Product Safety Commission (CPSC) sets the standards for child-resistant packaging, and all
          cannabis products sold in New York must meet these standards.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>Tamper-evident packaging</p>{" "}
        <p>
          Another important requirement for cannabis packaging in New York; it must be
          tamper-evident. This means that the packaging must be designed in such a way that it is
          clear if the product has been opened or tampered with before purchase. Tamper-evident
          packaging helps ensure the product's safety &amp; integrity and gives consumers peace of
          mind that they are getting what they paid for.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>Non-appealing child package branding</p>{" "}
        <p>
          In order to prevent minors from being attracted to cannabis products, packaging cannot
          contain any branding or advertising that could be appealing to children. This includes
          restrictions on the use of colors, images, and fonts.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>Accurate labeling</p>{" "}
        <p>
          Cannabis products sold in New York must also be accurately labeled. This includes
          information such as the THC and CBD content, dosage instructions, allergen warnings, and
          expiration date. Accurate labeling is important for consumers to make informed decisions
          about what they are buying and using.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>Warning labels</p>{" "}
        <p>
          In addition to accurate labeling, cannabis products sold in New York must also include
          warning labels. These labels must state that the product contains THC and may have
          intoxicating effects, as well as that minors, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or people
          with certain medical conditions should not use it. Warning labels help to ensure that
          consumers are aware of the potential risks associated with using cannabis products.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>Prohibition on marketing to minors</p>{" "}
        <p>
          Finally, it is important to note that cannabis packaging in New York cannot be designed to
          appeal to minors, and marketing or advertising cannot be targeted toward minors. This is
          an important step in ensuring that cannabis products are not marketed to children or
          teenagers and helps to prevent the normalization of drug use among young people.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>A Sustainable Program</p>{" "}

          </a>
          , New York requires cannabis businesses to incorporate “at least
          <strong> 25% post-recycled consumer content into their packaging</strong> and annually
          report key metrics on the implementation of their sustainability initiatives.”
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          In conclusion, the laws on cannabis packaging in New York are an important part of the
          state's new regulations surrounding recreational marijuana. By requiring child-resistant
          and tamper-evident packaging, plain packaging, accurate labeling, warning labels, and a
          prohibition on marketing to minors, the state is working to ensure the safety and
          well-being of its residents. If you are a cannabis user or seller in New York, it is
          important to be aware of these laws and comply with them to avoid legal trouble and ensure
          the safety of your customers.
