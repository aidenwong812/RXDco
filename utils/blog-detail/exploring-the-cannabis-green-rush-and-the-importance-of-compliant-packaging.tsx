        Exploring the Cannabis Green Rush and the importance of compliant packaging.
      </p>
      <div className="body">
        <p>
          Since the Gold Rush of 1848, there has been no other global economic "rush" to wealth
          other than what was ignited in 2012 and continues today; the Green Rush. The Green Rush
          began when cannabis was legalized in Washington and four days later in Colorado. As more
          states continue to legalize cannabis, an industry has emerged in the U.S. that is
          projected to reach $99 billion by the end of this year and $155 billion by 2026, with
          revenue generated not only from the sale of weed but from countless ancillary businesses,
          one of the most relevant being packaging.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Cannabis packaging is a crucial component not only to maintaining freshness, potency, and
          protection of cannabis, but it's also a key driver of a brand's sales through the package
          design, function, and the meeting of regulatory requirements that vary significantly from
          state to state.{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          With easy access to manufacturers in China, many seeking to capitalize on the Green Rush
          see packaging as an easy road into the industry. Unfortunately, most of these packaging
          "newbies" lack any packaging experience or knowledge of the complicated regulatory and
          compliance requirements. Due to their inexperience, these companies often create peril to
          whom they sell and close up shop as quickly as they opened.{" "}

          If you are exploring packaging options for your cannabis brand, ensure you vet the
          companies you are considering working with. To protect the integrity of your products and
          brand, stick to working with a company specializing in cannabis packaging. They should
          possess a broad understanding of the category and how they can best help you take your
          business to the next level with a wide variety of options and adherence to the required
          laws of the states where you sell.
